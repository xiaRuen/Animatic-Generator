## Project Description
### Idea & Concept
The song "Echo" was the inspiration for our music video, which combines art and technology. The song, performed by the synthetic vocalist Gumi and developed with voice synthesis software, represents an intersection of technology (Gumi) and human creativity. We has gone through a visually pleasing trip by utilising Processing's interactive capabilities. Our video, set against an arresting black-and-white backdrop, depicts the Cyborg's point of view through grayscale painting. We want to investigate the relationship between technology and humans in this environment by creating a story that goes beyond conventional music and visual arts. The mix of "Echo," Processing, and the Cyborg concept produces an immersive experience that conveys the song's profound meaning and intricate melody exceptionally.

### Application Framework
To implement the idea of code reusability, a simple video editing software is made. Instead of declaring a function that creates a shape and moves it, a physics component is instead created and can be attached to any sprite. Each sprite will then have a shape, which will be unique. Furthermore, one can specify the effects to add to a sprite, like pixelate, blur.
