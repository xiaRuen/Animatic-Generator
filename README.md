# echo

## Project Description
### Idea & Concept
The ethereal melodies of the song "Echo" serve as inspiration for the idea and concept we created for our music video, which is a creative journey that combines art and technology. The song was sung by a virtual Vocaloid (singing voice synthesizer software) called Gumi, where it gave the impression that the creators of the songs are more of a combination of the technology (Gumi) and the human (author). Using the interactive features of the Processing, we set off on an aesthetically stimulating journey. In keeping with the song's poignant lyrics, our film presents a mesmerising monochrome landscape, using grayscale painting to effectively convey the Cyborg's distinct point of view. We want to explore how technology and people interact in this black-and-white world by telling a narrative that goes beyond the bounds of conventional music and visual arts. The combination of "Echo," Processing software, and the overall Cyborgs theme should produce an immersive and visually striking experience that perfectly conveys the deep meaning and complex melody of the song.

### Application Framework
To implement the idea of code reusability, a simple video editing software is made. Instead of declaring a function that creates a shape and moves it, a physics component is instead created and can be attached to any sprite. Each sprite will then have a shape, which will be unique. Furthermore, one can specify the effects to add to a sprite, like pixelate, blur.
